<p align="center">A Telegram bot that helps you find random people to chat with in private messages.</p>

## Features

*   **Find Random People:** Connect with other users who are also looking for someone to chat with.
*   **Private Chats:** Once a match is found, the conversation takes place in your Telegram private messages, not within the bot interface.
*   **Profile Management:** Create, view, and delete your user profile.

## How to Use

1.  **Start the Bot:** Send the `/start` command to the bot to initialize it. You will receive a welcome message with a list of available commands.
2.  **Find a Random Person:** Use the `/find` command to find a random user. The bot will then send you the user's ID and profile description.
3.  **Initiate Chat:** To begin chatting, message the user directly on Telegram using the user ID provided by the bot.
4.  **Create Profile:** Use the `/new` command to create your profile.
5.  **View Profile:** Use the `/my` command to view your current profile.
6.  **Delete Profile:** Use the `/delete` command to remove your profile from the bot's system.

### Bot Commands

*   `/start` - Initializes the bot and displays available commands.
*   `/find` - Finds a random user for you to chat with.
*   `/new` - Create your own user profile.
*   `/my` - View your current user profile.
